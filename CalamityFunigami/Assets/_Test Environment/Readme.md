# TEST ENVIRONMENT

Before integrating new assets into the project:
    - Please first load them into the '_Test Environment' folder.
    - Use the 'Test Environment' scene to make sure all assets are working properly.
    - Once assets have been thoroughly tested they may then be reorganized into their proper asset folders in the main project.
